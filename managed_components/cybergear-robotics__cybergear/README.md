This driver uses Espressif's TWAI (Two-Wire Automotive Interface) in
order to communicate with Xiamoi CyberGear motors. It bases on the library
[Xiaomi_CyberGear_Arduino](https://github.com/DanielKalicki/Xiaomi_CyberGear_Arduino)
and is ported for ESP-IDF.

## Safety

This library does not use error logs/prints, but instead every internal error is
passed through. Therefore each relevant function returns `esp_err_t`, which should
be handled. During development `ESP_ERROR_CHECK(...)` helps, but due to the strength
of these motors, an error should be resolved or the motors should be stopped by an
external emergency mechanism.

Pay attention: The motor provides a list of faults. These are not tested yet and the code is beta.
Following lists the faults and whether a fault was already correctly tested:

* [ ] `overload`
* [ ] `uncalibrated`
* [ ] `over_current_phase_a`
* [ ] `over_current_phase_b`
* [ ] `over_current_phase_c`
* [ ] `over_voltage`
* [ ] `under_voltage`
* [ ] `driver_chip`
* [ ] `over_temperature`
* [ ] `magnetic_code_failure`
* [ ] `hall_coded_faults`

## Using component
```bash
idf.py add-dependency "cybergear-robotics/cybergear"
```

## Example

1. create example project
```bash
idf.py create-project-from-example "cybergear-robotics/cybergear:position_test"
```
2. Go to to example directory (for example `position_test`)
   `cd position_test`
3. Set ESP chip
   `idf.py set-target esp32`
4. Configure CAN TX/RX in menu `CyberGear Example`.
   `idf.py menuconfig`
5. Build, flash
   `idf.py build flash monitor`
